## Player Leaderboard
This fun tool allows users to rank players by their in-game statistics!

## Usage
It's as simple as inputting your category, criteria, and clicking **Load Leaderboard**.
The leaderboard will then be populated with the selected data!

## Data
Data is fetched from [player_data](../../../player-stats), which means it is **not** automatically updated.
Player data can be updated by committing updated statistics to that repo.
